</div>

<h2 align="center"> Overview </h2>

This report represents an in-depth analysis of a global e-commerce businesss specializing in popular gaming products. The available data contains approximately 22,000 transactions from 18,000 customers, covering the period from January 2019 to February 2021. The analysis will primarily focus on the 2019 - 2020 period to providing a clearer view of business performance before and during a major shift in global consumer behavior. The objective is to examine sales trends, product performance, and marketing effectiveness in order to identify key revenue drivers, uncover growth opportunities, and understand changes in customer purchasing behavior over time.

The key insights and recommendations of this analysis are structured around the following areas:

- General Sales Trends:
  - Analyze overall performance using key metrics such as total revenue, order volume, and average order value (AOV) to understand demand patterns and year-over-year changes.
- Product Performance:
  - Identify top products that contribute the most to the total revenue and assess their relative impacts on the overall performance of the business.
- Market Share by Region:
  - Evaluate regional contributions to sales, highlighting core revenue-driving markets as well as underperforming regions but show potential investment opportunities.
- Marketing Channels Effectiveness:
  - Evaluate the effectiveness of the business's marketing strategies by analyzing customer acquisition across different channels and identifying which channels contribute most to sales.

**Research Question:**

How do sales performance and marketing effectiveness vary by year, product, region, and channel, and what factors drive changes in revenue and order volume over time?

<h2 align="center"> Executive Summary </h2>

This analysis reveals several key patterns in sales and marketing performance:

1. **Sales Growth Accelerated Sharply in 2020, Followed by Early Signs of Decline**

   - Total revenue increased significantly in 2020, reaching $4.07M, representing a 164% year-over-year (YoY) growth.
   - The strongest performance occurred between September and December 2020, with December marking the peak month ($559K).
   - Despite strong annual growth, sales exhibited notable volatility, including a sharp decline in October 2020 and a continued downward trend in early 2021, suggesting that growth momentum may not be sustained without intervention.
  
2. **Revenue Is Highly Concentrated Among Top Products:**

   - A small group of products consistently generated the majority of revenue across both years.
   - This concentration reflects strong product–market fit for core offerings but also introduces dependency risk, as overall performance is heavily influenced by a limited product portfolio.

3. **Sales Trends Are Strongly Influenced by Global and Seasonal Factors:**

   - All regions and products experienced a pronounced decline in late 2019, followed by a sharp increase throughout 2020.
   - This synchronized pattern across markets suggests a macro-level impact, potentially related to shifts in consumer behavior during the COVID-19 period.
   - Seasonal effects are evident, with recurring peaks in September and December in both years, likely driven by promotional cycles and holiday demand, while October consistently underperformed across years.

4. **Marketing Channel Effectiveness Does Not Vary:**

   - Direct traffic dominates sales performance, contributing approximately 70–80% of total revenue.
   - Other channels (email, social media, affiliate) contribute minimally, indicating inefficient channel diversification and potential underinvestment or ineffective execution outside the direct channel.

<h2 align="center"> Insight Deep Dive & Visualizations </h2>

### 💰 Sales Trends

- In 2019, monthly sales remained relatively stable throughout the year, with the strongest performance occurring during September - December period, which generated approximately $637K of the $1.54M annual revenue (around 42% of total sales)
- Despite this strong accomplishment at the end of the year, sales experience a sharp 39% decline in January 2020, indicating a significant post-holiday slowdown and an early sign of volatility entering the new year.
- Sales revenue rebounded rapidly in the next few months of 2020. By April 2020, revenue increased by over 220% compared to January 2020 (from $109K to $351K) and nearly 190% compared to April 2019, indicating a pronounced year-over-year surge and a clear deviation from prior patterns.
- Despite this surge, monthly sales patterns reveal strong month-to-month volatility, with recurring declines before and after seasonal peaks. This pattern highlights that customer demand was heavily concentrated around specific promotional or holiday-driven periods rathern than sustained throughout the year.
- Entering 2021, the revenue sharply declined again, with a 47% drop in January, followed by further decline in February, suggests potential demand saturation or weakening consumer engagement.
- **Overall:** Although the difference in total revenue of the 2 seasons are susbtantial, sales followed a consistent seasonal pattern: peak in September and December, followed by decline in adjacent months. This essentially indicates that revenue performance is heavily dependent on late-year seasonal events and promotions, reinforcing the need for adjusting strategies that stabilize general demand outside peak periods.

### 📊 Average Order Value (AOV) and Number of Orders

- In 2020, Average Order Value (AOV) increased significantly compared to the previous year, with a notable 36% spike in January 2020. This increase coincided with the outbreak of COVID-19, which likely influenced changes in consumer purchasing behavior within the e-commerce market.
- However, higher AOV did not consistently translate into higher revenue. In fact, revenue in January 2020 reach one of its lowest level across the analyzed period, indicating that increasing the AOV alone was insufficient to complement the declines in customer demand.
- Visualizing the number of orders proves that declines in order volume, rather than AOV, were the primary driver of revenue downturns. Order count and total revenue closely mirror each other across both years, emphasizing that decline in revenue primarily due to fewer orders rather than the fluctuation in AOV or price of the products.
  - In January 2020, the number of orders declined by approxiamtely 55%, directly leading to the sharp revenue drop despite having high AOV.
  - Order volume recovered throughout 2020 and peaked in December with 1,671 orders, but also experienced notable declines in October 2020 and again in early 2021.
- **Overall:** While AOV exhibited considerable volatility over the analyzed period, order volume was more likely the main driver of the revenue. This emphasizes the importance of sustaining the consistent demand rather than solely focus on short-term increases in order value.

### 🎮 Product Performance by Year

- Revenue concentration is extreme: four products - Gaming Monitor, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Ideapad Gaming - account for approximately 97% of total revenue across both years.
- Several products show minimal or inconsistent sales activity, contributing negligibly to overall performance.
- The Gaming Headset exhibited persistently weak performance, with no recorded sales in multiple months, indicating poor product-market fit, ineffective promotion, or missing sales data.

### 🌐 Market Share by Region

- North America consistently dominates revenue:
  - It accounts for over 50% of total sales in both year and serves as the primary revenue driver across all products.
  - Revenue in this region increased from $832.7K in 2019 to $2.12M in 2020, representing a 155% year-over-year (YoY) growth, reinforcing North America's central role in overall business performance, but also highlighting the risk of over-reliance on a specific region.
- In contrast, Latin America accounts for the smalles sphare (approximately 5%), indicating limited market penetration and relatively low impact on overall performance.
- Regional sales trends differed between ealy 2019 and later in 2019:
  - In early 2019, North America and EMEA followed similar patterns, both experiencing a noticeable decline in February, while Asia-Pacific and Latin America showed relatively steady growth during the same period, despite their smaller revenue contributions.
  - Later in 2019, sales patterns converged across North America, EMEA, and Asia-Pacific, with all three regions peaking in September followed by a significant decline toward November and December, suggesting a global or cross-regional factor that might affect customer demand. Notably, Latin America remained relatively stable during this period, showing less sensitivity to the same demand shifts.
- In 2020, all regions exhibited highly aligned sales behavior. Each experienced with a sharp decline in early 2020, followed by a strong recovery and peak performance primarily in September and December, although with increased volatility in the latter half of the year. This consistent pattern across regions supports the presence of a global demand shock, likely associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
- **Overall:** While most regions showed improvement toward the end of 2020, Asia-Pacific was the only region to maintain continued growth into early 2021. Combine with a slight increase in its market share in 2020, this trend highlights Asia-Pacific as a potential emerging growth opportunity. 

### 📈 Marketing Channels Effectiveness

- Direct purchases account for the vast majority of revenue (70–80%), while all other channels contribute marginally.
- This heavy reliance on direct traffic is atypical for mature e-commerce operations and suggests underutilization or inefficiency in marketing strategies.
- Email shows modest growth potential, while social media and affiliate channels appear underdeveloped rather than ineffective, indicating opportunities for strategic experimentation and optimization.

<h2 align="center"> Conclusion </h2>

### Key Takeaways

- Revenue growth in 2020 was driven primarily by increased order volume, not sustained improvements in AOV.
- Sales performance is highly dependent on a narrow set of products, increasing exposure to product-level risk.
- Regional demand patterns suggest both mature markets and emerging growth opportunities.
- Marketing performance is constrained by over-reliance on direct traffic and limited channel diversification.

### Business Implications

- Sustainable growth requires balancing volume growth, product diversification, and channel optimization.
- Improving demand generation through diversified marketing channels is critical to reducing revenue volatility.
- Strategic focus should shift from short-term revenue spikes to stable, repeatable growth drivers.

<h2 align="center"> Recommendations </h2>

- Rationalize the product portfolio by discontinuing or repositioning persistently underperforming products.
- Reduce over-reliance on direct traffic by strengthening email, social media, and affiliate strategies through targeted campaigns and experimentation. Email shows a potential improve so this can be a method that marketing team can focus on. Although social media and affeliate show much lower contribution, I think that these 2 channels are also potential since as a customer I found myself most of the time discovering products through these 2 channels.
- Double down on high-performing regions while investing selectively in regions showing emerging growth, particularly Asia-Pacific.
- Align promotional strategies more closely with proven seasonal demand patterns while mitigating recurring low-performance periods (e.g., October).
