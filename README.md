### 💰 Sales Trends

### Average Order Value (AOV)

### Product Performance by Year

### Key Takeaways

### Business Implications

<h2 align="center"> Recommendations </h2>

- discontinue the product with low performance
- improving marketing strategies on email, social media, and affeliate to avoid over-reliance on the direct channel. Email shows a potential improve so this can be a method that marketing team can focus on while social media and affeliate show much lower contribution, I think that these 2 channels are also potential since as a customer I found myself most of the time discovering products through these 2 channels.
- focusing on enhancing promotions and marketing strategies in region that shows strong performance or one that makes progress
